! The following parameters are mandatory.
&required
odir  = 'tables' ! Output directory.
d     = 5        ! Number of matching points in physical domain.
c     = 25       ! Number of continuation points to use.
tkind = 0        ! =0 creates projector for Dirichlet boundary condition
!                ! and if compiled with BLEND=yes the blend-to-zero operator.
!                ! =1 creates projector for Neumann BC.
!                ! =2 creates projector for second normal derivative BC.
/

! These are parameters for the SVD and partial outputs. If left blank,
! the code will run for 200 iterations and won't output partial results,
! just the resulting blend to zero operator A.
&svd
iters     =      ! Number of SVD iterations to perform. 
resume    =      ! 0 for fresh SVD start, 1 to resume from `svd_temp.dat`
sstep     =      ! Save U and V every sstep SVD iterations.
eigenmin  =      ! Singular values smaller than eigenmin are considered 0.
/

! These parameters are optional and can be left blank.
! In that case, the code will try to make educated guesses.
! Use only in case of convergence problems or very slow iterations.
&option
o    =           ! Oversampling factor.
bw   =           ! Bandwith reduction.
z    =           ! Points in the (non oversampled) zero region.
e    =           ! Grid extension points (points after zero region).
